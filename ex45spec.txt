You are a junior high student and your pops don't send you lunch money. You have
posh classmates that are willing to pay for you to go buy their lunch, all of them pay upfront for cost.

There are many places within the school where you can buy the same kind of food,
although there are two places outside the school that where you are at risk of
getting in trouble due to sneaking out.

Going outside can take a couple more turns but prices are much much lower

You have 30 minutes (60 turns) to get as much money as you can, before recess is over.
If you get caught outside school grounds you'll get a 10 turn penalty in the
principals office.

The more food you're carrying the more you risk spilling or dropping something, and you will have to pay it back if it happens. Try not to carry more than 4 deliveries at a time,
although you can still take more orders without a problem.

Sometimes they will come looking for you, others you'll have to look for them.
Classmates can be Rich(0.2), Mid(0.1) or Poor(0.05) and will tip you accordingly.

While waiting for an order you can't leave the scene.

Delivering also takes a turn.

Going between places takes time as well.
You can pick what to buy at each place.
